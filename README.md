# CustomKeyboardKit_TextFieldAxis_BugDemo

## To use the demonstration:

1. Open the project in Xcode
1. Select a development team in the Signing & Capabilities editor
1. Launch the app on iPhone
1. Editing the first text field (without the `axis` argument) clearly shows the custom keyboard. Editing the second (with the `axis` argument) brings up the standard keyboard.

Presumably the custom keyboard should work whether the axis argument is supplied or not.
